  "reasoning": "This image shows a stylized illustration representing digital connectivity and e-commerce within the European Union, featuring EU flag stars and connected containers with shopping cart and building icons. It provides visual context about digital infrastructure and European integration that would not be available to screen reader users from surrounding text alone. The symbolic representation of the digital single market concept adds meaningful information beyond what typical text descriptions would convey, making it informative rather than decorative.",
