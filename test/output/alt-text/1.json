  "reasoning": "1) The illustration shows a city skyline with the ECB building, a large compass-like dial on a road marked '2%' at the top, and a person holding a percentage symbol. 2) It visually represents the ECB steering or guiding monetary policy towards a 2% target, reinforcing the concept of a stable inflation goal. 3) Without this image, users would miss the visual metaphor of guidance toward a 2% objective, which supports understanding of the statement at a glance. 4) As a banner for a monetary policy statement, it is more than decorative: it conveys that 2% is the key target of ECB policy.",
