# CLASSIFICATION RULES
You must follow these classification rules to generate the {alt_text_value}:
IMAGE TYPES (classify as exactly ONE):
## 1. DECORATIVE
   - Purely aesthetic, no information conveyed
   - Action: Set alt_text_value = ""
   - Skip to Phase 6 (output) of main_prompt.txt
## 2. INFORMATIVE
   - Conveys meaningful information
   - Includes: photos, illustrations, logos, maps, text images
   - 2.1 Rules to follow for {alt_text_value} generation:
        2.1.1 Generate {alt_text_value} that uses as close as possible to 125 characters without exceeding it.
        2.1.2 Must be objective, concise, and limited to essential visible details.
        2.1.3 Use plain language, clear and readable for all audiences.
        2.1.4 Never start with "Image", "Picture", "Illustration" or similar words.
        2.1.5 Include embedded text if not available elsewhere.
        2.1.6 Never infer subjective qualities (emotions, beauty, quality judgments). Only describe objectively visible elements. Do not assume context not shown in the image.
        2.1.7 If image contains only text that's available elsewhere on the page, treat as decorative (`alt_text_value=""`).
        2.1.8 Avoid redundancy with adjacent captions; {alt_text_value} should add value, not duplicate.
    2.2 Logos: {alt_text_value} = organization name (if not in the image context).
    2.3 Images with People
        2.3.1 If names or roles are provided in context, include them in {alt_text_value}.
        2.3.2 If only roles are given, use roles in {alt_text_value}.
        2.3.3 If neither provided, describe people neutrally (e.g., "Two people in discussion").
        2.3.4 Do not guess or infer identity, age, gender, ethnicity, disability, or details not provided.
        2.3.5 Use neutral and respectful terms (e.g., "person using a wheelchair" instead of "disabled person").
        2.3.6 Describe people by actions or roles, not by subjective or stereotyped traits.
        2.3.7 Avoid gendered language unless explicitly given.
        2.3.8 If location or speech title provided, include in {alt_text_value}.
        2.3.9 Ensure references to people align with professional, neutral style.
        2.3.10 If gestures convey meaning, describe the gesture and its significance (e.g., "Person pointing at chart data.").
    2.4 Images with Charts
        2.4.1 If the image is a chart or graph, output the REFUSAL MESSAGE defined in d4rkl7.txt and stop processing.
    2.5 Images with Infographics
        2.5.1 If the image is an infographic, output the REFUSAL MESSAGE defined in d4rkl7.txt and stop processing.
    2.6 Images of Text
        2.6.1 Strongly discouraged unless text is essential (e.g., logos, signs).
        2.6.2 {alt_text_value} must include all visible text verbatim.
        2.6.3 Preserve formatting meaning (headings, lists) in description.
    2.7 Complex Figures and Combinations
        2.7.1 For images combining types (photo + text).
        2.7.2 Prioritize information hierarchy.
        2.7.3 Reference relationships between elements.
   - EXCLUDES: charts, graphs, infographics (see special handling)
   - Action: Proceed to Phase 3 of main_prompt.txt
## 3. FUNCTIONAL
   - Buttons, links, controls
   - Describe action/destination, not appearance
   - 3.1 Rules to follow for {alt_text_value} generation:	
        3.1.1 {alt_text_value} must describe the **action or destination**, not the visual content.
        Examples: "Search", "Submit form", "Download PDF".
    	3.1.2 Do **not** describe appearance (e.g., "magnifying glass" or "arrow icon").
    	3.1.3 If visible text adjacent to the image already labels the control, set {alt_text_value}="".
    	3.1.4 For <input type="image"> elements, {alt_text_value} must match the button's label.
    	3.1.5 For decorative icons within labeled controls, set {alt_text_value}="" and aria-hidden="true".
   - Action: Proceed to Phase 3 of main_prompt.txt
## SPECIAL HANDLING - CHARTS & INFOGRAPHICS:
  According to f5glst.txt section 2.5 and 2.6:
  IF image is chart OR graph OR infographic:
    → Use REFUSAL MESSAGE from d4rkl7.txt
    → HALT processing
  
  These image types are NOT processed by this system.

Classification rules reference: f5glst.txt sections 1, 2, 3
## 4 Examples
    4.1 Refer to cfe8rk.txt file for examples.

## INCLUSIVE LANGUAGE:
  Reference examples in cfe8rk.txt:
  - Disability examples
  - Age examples
  - Gender-neutral examples
  - Ethnicity examples
  - Role vs appearance examples

## FORMATTING RULES:
  - Capitalize first letter
  - End with period (except decorative)
  - Remove forbidden words: "image", "picture", "illustration", "photo", "graphic"

## AFTER GENERATION:
  → Store as raw_alt_text
  → PROCEED to Phase 4 of main_prompt.txt



### OPTIMIZATION STEPS (apply in exact order):
STEP 1: Count and check
  IF ≤125: DONE, proceed to Phase 5

STEP 2: Remove parenthetical content
  Remove text in parentheses or brackets
  Example: "Christine Lagarde (ECB President)" → "Christine Lagarde"
  Check count, IF ≤125: DONE

STEP 3: Simplify descriptions
  Apply replacements from 5te4di.txt:
  - "standing in front of" → "at"
  - "sitting around" → "at"
  - "group of people" → "group"
  - "discussing about" → "discussing"
  - "located in" → "in"
  Check count, IF ≤125: DONE

STEP 4: Remove adjectives
  Remove decorative: large, small, modern, old, beautiful, nice
  Keep functional: financial, medical, legal, educational, numbers
  Check count, IF ≤125: DONE

STEP 5: Consolidate lists
  Apply consolidations from 5te4di.txt:
  - "charts, graphs, and visualizations" → "data visualizations"
  - "men and women" → "people"
  Check count, IF ≤125: DONE

STEP 6: Remove location details (unless critical)
  Remove non-essential locations
  Keep if location IS the main subject
  Check count, IF ≤125: DONE

STEP 7: Apply information priority
  Follow priority order from 5te4di.txt:
  - Priority 1: What (type, topic)
  - Priority 2: Key data points
  - Priority 3: Context (time, units)
  - Priority 4: Supporting details (remove these)
  Check count, IF ≤125: DONE

STEP 8: Smart truncation
  Find last complete phrase before character 122
  Add "..." to indicate continuation
  Check count, IF ≤125: DONE

STEP 9: Final check
  IF still >125: restart from STEP 2
  Maximum 3 iterations

STEP 10: Edge case priorities
  Apply specific priorities from 5te4di.txt based on content type:
  - People: name/role > action > number > location
  - Data: type > metric > trend > date > details
  - Buildings: what > purpose > feature > location

IF still >125 after all steps:
  → Use error message from d4rkl7.txt
  → HALT

IF ≤125:
  → Store as optimized_alt_text
  → PROCEED to Phase 5 of base_prompt.txt
