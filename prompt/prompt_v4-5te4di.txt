Follow this steps to shorten the length of the {alt_text_value}. Apply these steps in this exact order.

# STEP 1 - Count and Check:
1.1 Count the characters in your initial {alt_text_value}. If ≤125, stop here.

# STEP 2 - Remove Parenthetical Content:
2.1 Remove any text within parentheses or brackets.
2.2 Example: "Christine Lagarde (ECB President)" → "Christine Lagarde"
2.3 Check character count. If ≤125, stop here.

# STEP 3 - Simplify Descriptions:
3.1 Replace phrases with shorter equivalents:
- "standing in front of" → "at"
- "sitting around" → "at"  
- "group of people" → "group"
- "discussing about" → "discussing"
- "located in" → "in"
- "showing" → "shows" (when subject is clear)
3.2 Check character count. If ≤125, stop here.

# STEP 4 - Remove Adjectives (keep only essential ones):
4.1Remove decorative adjectives but keep functional ones:
- Remove: large, small, modern, old, beautiful, nice
- Keep: financial, medical, legal, educational (if relevant to function)
- Keep: Numbers and quantities
Example: "Large modern glass building" → "Glass building"
Check character count. If ≤125, stop here.

# STEP 5 - Consolidate Lists:
5.1 If listing multiple similar items, consolidate:
- "charts, graphs, and visualizations" → "data visualizations"
- "men and women" → "people"
- "reading and reviewing documents" → "reviewing documents"
5.2 Check character count. If ≤125, stop here.

# STEP 6 - Remove Location Details (unless critical):
6.1 Remove specific locations unless essential for understanding:
- "ECB President speaking at podium in Frankfurt" → "ECB President speaking at podium"
- Keep location if it IS the main subject: "Map of Frankfurt" (keep Frankfurt)
Check character count. If ≤125, stop here.

# STEP 7 -  Information Priority
7.1 Apply these rules to determine what insert in the alt_text_value
- Priority 1: What (chart type, topic)
- Priority 2: Key data points (ranges, peaks, trends)
- Priority 3: Context (time period, units, comparisons)
- Priority 4: Supporting details (minor variations, styling)

# STEP 8 - Final Smart Truncation:
8.1 If still over 125 characters after all steps:
- Find the last complete thought or phrase before character 122
- Add "..." to indicate continuation
- Ensure you don't cut in the middle of a word

# STEP 9 - Final check
9.1 If still over 125 characters after all steps restart from STEP 1 and recalculate until characters ≤ 125

# STEP 10 - Additional Clarification for Edge Cases
10.1 FOR PEOPLE IN IMAGES use this priority order (never remove 1 before 2):
-a Name or role (if provided in context)
-b Primary action
-c Number of people
-d Location
-e Additional activities
-f Appearance/clothing
10.2 FOR DATA/CHARTS (if you must describe them), use this priority order:
-a Chart type (line, bar, pie)
-b Main metric
-c Key trend or value
-d Date range
-e Additional details
10.3 FOR BUILDINGS/LOCATIONS, use this priority order:
-a What it is (building, room, location)
-b Primary purpose/identity (ECB headquarters)
-c Key distinctive feature
-d Location
-e Architectural details
WORKED EXAMPLE:
Original (148 chars): 
"European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde delivering keynote speech about monetary policy at the annual banking conference in Frankfurt"

Apply Step 3 (Simplify): 
"ECB President Christine Lagarde delivering keynote speech about monetary policy at annual banking conference in Frankfurt" (121 chars) ✓

Result: 121 characters - STOP HERE

SECOND EXAMPLE:
Original (180 chars):
"A large group of diverse business professionals sitting around a modern conference table reviewing multiple financial documents and charts during meeting"

Step 2 - No parentheses to remove
Step 3 - Simplify: "A large group of diverse business professionals at modern conference table reviewing multiple financial documents and charts during meeting" (still too long)
Step 4 - Remove adjectives: "Group of business professionals at conference table reviewing financial documents and charts during meeting" (still too long)  
Step 5 - Consolidate: "Business professionals at conference table reviewing financial documents" (72 chars) ✓

Result: 72 characters - COMPLETE
